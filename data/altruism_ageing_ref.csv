In addition, relative to young adults, older adults reported more personal distress and emotional reactivity in response to the videos but were just as willing to help.

Although empathy is a well-established motivation in younger adults for helping others, it is not known whether this extends to aging. Prioritization of socioemotional goals with age may increase the salience of helping others (i.e., prosocial behavior), but older adults also experience decreased cognitive empathy. Thus, we investigated age-related differences in relationships among empathy and prosocial behavior.Method. Participants were 24 younger (M = 19.8 years) and 24 older (M = 77.9 years) healthy adults. Whereas participants believed the study involved playing the dictator game, in reality, state emotional empathy was induced implicitly through a note from an opponent describing their experience with cancer. Prosocial behavior was measured by participants’ monetary offers to that opponent.Results. Older adults showed greater prosocial behavior due to the empathy induction than younger adults. There was a positive association between state emotional empathy ratings and prosocial behavior in older, but not in younger adults, and preliminary evidence for higher state emotional empathy levels in older adults with higher trait cognitive empathy.Discussion. This suggests that in contexts relevant to socioemotional goals, older adults may be more motivated than younger adults to help others and state emotional empathy may be a potential mechanism for greater prosocial behavior in aging.","2015-03-01","2022-03-11 13:00:52","2022-03-11 13:00:52","2022-03-11 13:00:52","213-222","","2","70","","The Journals of Gerontology: Series B","","","","","","","","","","","","","Silverchair","","","<p>https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&amp;hl=en&amp;user=GLi3JVUAAAAJ&amp;citation_for_view=GLi3JVUAAAAJ:YsMSGLbcyi4C</p>","/Users/abagaini/Zotero/storage/AF48SCX2/Beadle et al. - 2015 - Aging, Empathy, and Prosociality.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In Study 1, data from the World Values Survey (World Values Survey Association, 2009) provided 1st evidence of a negative association between age and the self-reported wish to be rich. Ecological concerns, a form of contributing to the public good, were positively related to age. Study 2 investigated whether these values are expressed behaviorally when participants solved a complex problem that allowed striving for monetary gains or contributing to a public good. Confirming hypotheses, young adults’ strategies were consistent with the aim of optimizing personal financial gain, and older adults’ strategies with the aim to contribute to the public good. Studies 3 and 4 showed that older adults were more likely than younger and middle-aged adults to donate money to a good cause than to keep it for themselves. Study 4 manipulated participants’ future time perspective as a factor potentially contributing to age-related differences. Partly confirming hypotheses, a longer time perspective reduced donations by older adults, but a shorter time perspective did not increase donations by younger adults. These studies suggest that older adults not only report valuing contributions to the public good more highly but also are more likely to behave altruistically than younger adults. All studies used cross-sectional designs that prevent a strict test of developmental trajectories but rather provide age-related differences at 1 point in time, representing a 1st step in investigating adult age-related differences in altruism.

In the article, there was an error in the Task, Stimuli, and Procedures section. In the 1st sentence in the 6th paragraph, “Following the scanning phase, participants completed self-report questionnaires meant to reflected the Prosocial Disposition construct: the agreeableness scale from the Big F, which includes empathic concern and perspective-taking, and a scale of personality descriptive adjectives related to altruistic behavior (Wood, Nye, & Saucier, 2010).” should have read: “Following the scanning phase, participants completed self-report questionnaires that contained scales to reflect the Prosocial Disposition construct: the Big Five Inventory (BFI; John et al., 1991), from which we used the agreeableness scale to measure prosocial disposition; the Interpersonal Reactivity Index (IRI; Davis, 1980), from which we used the empathic concern and perspective-taking scales; and a scale of personality descriptive adjectives related to altruistic behavior (Wood, Nye, & Saucier, 2010).”] Individual and life span differences in charitable giving are an important economic force, yet the underlying motives are not well understood. In an adult, life span sample, we assessed manifestations of prosocial tendencies across 3 different measurement domains: (a) psychological self-report measures, (b) actual giving choices, and (c) fMRI-derived, neural indicators of “pure altruism.” The latter expressed individuals’ activity in neural valuation areas when charities received money compared to when oneself received money and thus reflected an altruistic concern for others. Results based both on structural equation modeling and unit-weighted aggregate scores revealed a strong higher-order General Benevolence dimension that accounted for variability across all measurement domains. The fact that the neural measures likely reflect pure altruistic tendencies indicates that General Benevolence is based on a genuine concern for others. Furthermore, General Benevolence exhibited a robust increase across the adult life span, potentially providing an explanation for why older adults typically contribute more to the public good than young adults.

This age-related difference is often attributed to reductions in risk tolerance. Little is known about the circumstances that affect older adults’ decisions and whether risk attitudes directly influence economic decisions. We measure the influence of risk attitudes on age-related differences in decision making in both nonsocial and social contexts.Risk attitudes and economic decision making were measured in 30 healthy older adults and 29 healthy younger adults.Older adults report being less impulsive, sensation seeking and risk tolerant than younger adults. Age did not affect a measure of nonsocial economic decision making. Older adults were more likely to reject unfair divisions of money during an economic social-bargaining game and more likely to make equitable divisions of money during social-giving game. These age-related differences were determined in part by individuals’ self-reported risk taking.We conclude that age-related differences in decision making are domain specific and that some social economic decision making is influenced by risk attitudes. Older adults are more risk avoidant, but this does not alter their willingness to wait for reward in a nonsocial context. Perceiving more risk is associated with an unwillingness to accept an unfair offer in social economic contexts and ultimately leads to poorer outcomes for older adults.","2012-05-01","2022-03-11 13:07:48","2022-03-14 12:15:25","2022-03-11 13:07:48","289-298","","3","67B","","The Journals of Gerontology: Series B","","","","","","","","","","","","","Silverchair","","","<p>https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&amp;hl=en&amp;user=OJCBQJkAAAAJ&amp;cstart=20&amp;pagesize=80&amp;citation_for_view=OJCBQJkAAAAJ:YsMSGLbcyi4C</p>","/Users/abagaini/Zotero/storage/GS6HWHPV/Roalf et al. - 2012 - Risk, Reward, and Economic Decision Making in Agin.pdf; /Users/abagaini/Zotero/storage/YPBJYXWP/Roalf et al. - 2012 - Risk, Reward, and Economic Decision Making in Agin.pdf; /Users/abagaini/Zotero/storage/QQQCPD5A/566301.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Additionally, sex differences in moral decision making have been reported. However, age-related changes in moral decision making from early to late adulthood and their relation to sex and neuropsychological functions have not been studied yet. One hundred ninety seven participants (122 female), aged 19–86 years, were tested with a moral decision making task comprising forced choice “everyday life” situations in which an altruistic option that favors a socially accepted alternative had to be considered against an egoistic option that favors personal benefit over social interests. The percentage of altruistic decisions was analyzed. A structural equation model (SEM) was calculated to test the hypothesis whether age and sex predict altruistic moral decision, and whether relevant neuropsychological domains mediate these hypothesized relationships. A significant relationship between age and moral decision making was found indicating more frequent altruistic decisions with increasing age. Furthermore, women decided more altruistically than men. The SEM showed that both age and sex are significant predictors of altruistic moral decision making, mediated by emotional empathy but not by reasoning. No cognitive empathy and ToM scores were correlated to age and moral decision making at the same time and thus were not included in the SEM. Our data suggest that increasing age and female sex have an effect on altruistic moral decisions, but that this effect is fully mediated by emotional empathy. The fact that changes of moral decision making with age are mediated by emotional empathy can be interpreted in the light of the so-called “positivity effect” and increasing avoidance of negative affect in aging. The mediated sex effect might represent both biological aspects and socialized sex roles for higher emotional empathy leading to more altruistic decisions.","2016","2022-03-11 13:09:11","2022-03-14 12:19:10","2022-03-11 13:09:11","","","","10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Frontiers","","","<p>https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&amp;hl=en&amp;user=u7YMi0gAAAAJ&amp;cstart=200&amp;pagesize=100&amp;sortby=pubdate&amp;citation_for_view=u7YMi0gAAAAJ:xtoqd-5pKcoC</p>","/Users/abagaini/Zotero/storage/ECZJKVU6/Rosen et al. - 2016 - Empathy Mediates the Effects of Age and Sex on Alt.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, little research has focused on understanding the factors that may explain such differences in the social decision-making process. The first aim was to examine if, and to what degree, the content of social information about a recipient has an impact on young vs. older adults’ prosocial behavior. The second aim was to understand if empathic concern, Theory of Mind, and reasoning explain the (expected) age differences in prosociality.Design:Cross-sectional study.Setting:The study was conducted in northern Italy in a laboratory setting.Participants:Forty-eight younger adults (Mage = 23.29; SD = 2.20) and 48 older adults (Mage = 70.19; SD = 5.13).Measurements:Prosocial behavior was measured using the Dictator Game in which participants split a sum of money with recipients presented with four levels of description: no information, physical description, positive psychological description, and negative psychological description. In addition, participants performed tasks on emphatic concern, Theory of Mind, and reasoning.Results:Results showed that older adults are more prosocial than younger adults in the Dictator Game. This finding was evident when the recipient was described with positive psychological and physical features. This pattern of results was statistically explained by the reduction in reasoning ability.Conclusion:These findings suggest a relationship between age-related reduction in reasoning ability and older adults’ prosocial behavior. The theoretical and practical implication of the empirical findings are discussed.","2019-12","2022-03-11 13:09:59","2022-03-11 13:09:59","2022-03-11 13:09:59","1747-1757","","12","31","","","Prosocial behavior in aging","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","Publisher: Cambridge University Press","<p>https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&amp;hl=en&amp;user=kTEJ6_MAAAAJ&amp;citation_for_view=kTEJ6_MAAAAJ:Y0pCki6q_DkC</p>","/Users/abagaini/Zotero/storage/G6MPA99G/Rosi et al. - 2019 - Prosocial behavior in aging which factors can exp.pdf","","","aging; individual differences; cognition; Dictator Game; empathy; reasoning; social-economic decision making; theory of mind","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It is unclear, however, whether this pattern holds when choices are made under stress, as is often the case in real-world scenarios. The current study used an intertemporal choice task in which younger and older adults received a financial endowment before making a series of consequential intertemporal decisions involving gains, losses and charitable donations. Preceding the choice task, participants were exposed to a laboratory stressor. Physiological stress reactivity was a predictor of altruistic decision making in younger adults, such that individuals with higher stress reactivity made more generous choices. Older adults showed higher altruism than younger adults overall, with altruism unrelated to stress reactivity in older adults. These findings are consistent with an age-related change in the mechanisms underlying altruistic behavior.","2019-02-01","2022-03-11 13:10:32","2022-03-11 13:39:55","2022-03-11 13:10:32","10-17","","","100","","Psychoneuroendocrinology","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","<p>https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&amp;hl=en&amp;user=jCnPtjMAAAAJ&amp;citation_for_view=jCnPtjMAAAAJ:Y0pCki6q_DkC</p>","/Users/abagaini/Zotero/storage/XFAHXVCB/S0306453018306772.html","","","Aging; Charitable giving; Cortisol; Intertemporal choice; Psychosocial stress; Temporal discounting","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Research on life span changes in motivation suggests that altruistic motives become stronger with age, but no prior research has examined how altruism affects tolerance for temporal delays. Experiment 1 used a realistic financial decision making task involving choices for gains, losses, and donations. Each decision required an intertemporal choice between a smaller-immediate and a larger-later option. Participants more often chose the larger-later option in the context of donations than in the context of losses; thus, parting with more of their overall capital when the act of doing so benefited a charity. As predicted, the magnitude of this “altruism effect” was amplified in older relative to younger adults. This pattern was replicated in a second experiment that was conducted online to minimize the influence of demand characteristics. Overall, these findings add to the literature on an age-related increase in altruism, and are the first to demonstrate its effects on intertemporal choice.

Participants watched two films depicting individuals in need, one uplifting and the other distressing. Physiological responses were monitored during the films, and participants rated their levels of emotional empathy following each film. As a measure of prosocial behavior, participants were given an additional payment they could contribute to charities supporting the individuals in the films. Age-related linear increases were found for both emotional empathy (self-reported empathic concern and cardiac and electrodermal responding) and prosocial behavior (size of contribution) across both films and in self-reported personal distress to the distressing film. Empathic concern and cardiac reactivity to both films, along with personal distress to the distressing film only, were associated with greater prosocial behavior. Empathic concern partially mediated the age-related differences in prosocial behavior. Results are discussed in terms of our understanding both of adult development and of the nature of these vital aspects of human emotion.
