Drawing on a sample of 13,198 individuals, from the 2012-2013 cross-sectional STEP Skills Measurement Survey, we find that higher temporal discounting is more positively associated with the likelihood of self-employment. We further find that younger individuals with higher temporal discounting are more likely to engage in self-employment. The association of lower socioeconomic status at a young age or those who experienced economic shocks at a young age with the likelihood of self-employment is only significant when interaction effects of temporal discounting and age are present in the model. Risk seeking is not associated with the likelihood of engagement in self-employment under higher discounting. These findings have implications for the self-employment literature as well as the literature on behavioral decision making.","2017-04","2022-01-14 14:48:28","2022-03-14 12:17:16","","861-882","","4","48","","","","","","","","","","","","","","WOS:000400384800004","","","","<p>https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&amp;hl=en&amp;user=rKsuNOEAAAAJ&amp;cstart=20&amp;pagesize=80&amp;sortby=pubdate&amp;citation_for_view=rKsuNOEAAAAJ:roLk4NBRz8UC</p>","/Users/abagaini/Zotero/storage/63BNIBES/Wolfe and Patel - 2017 - Instant gratification temporal discounting and se.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This age-related difference is often attributed to reductions in risk tolerance. Little is known about the circumstances that affect older adults’ decisions and whether risk attitudes directly influence economic decisions. We measure the influence of risk attitudes on age-related differences in decision making in both nonsocial and social contexts.Risk attitudes and economic decision making were measured in 30 healthy older adults and 29 healthy younger adults.Older adults report being less impulsive, sensation seeking and risk tolerant than younger adults. Age did not affect a measure of nonsocial economic decision making. Older adults were more likely to reject unfair divisions of money during an economic social-bargaining game and more likely to make equitable divisions of money during social-giving game. These age-related differences were determined in part by individuals’ self-reported risk taking.We conclude that age-related differences in decision making are domain specific and that some social economic decision making is influenced by risk attitudes. Older adults are more risk avoidant, but this does not alter their willingness to wait for reward in a nonsocial context. Perceiving more risk is associated with an unwillingness to accept an unfair offer in social economic contexts and ultimately leads to poorer outcomes for older adults.","2012-05-01","2022-03-11 13:07:48","2022-03-14 12:15:25","2022-03-11 13:07:48","289-298","","3","67B","","The Journals of Gerontology: Series B","","","","","","","","","","","","","Silverchair","","","<p>https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&amp;hl=en&amp;user=OJCBQJkAAAAJ&amp;cstart=20&amp;pagesize=80&amp;citation_for_view=OJCBQJkAAAAJ:YsMSGLbcyi4C</p>","/Users/abagaini/Zotero/storage/GS6HWHPV/Roalf et al. - 2012 - Risk, Reward, and Economic Decision Making in Agin.pdf; /Users/abagaini/Zotero/storage/YPBJYXWP/Roalf et al. - 2012 - Risk, Reward, and Economic Decision Making in Agin.pdf; /Users/abagaini/Zotero/storage/QQQCPD5A/566301.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The current study used an intertemporal choice task in which younger and older adults received a financial endowment before making a series of consequential intertemporal decisions involving gains, losses and charitable donations. Preceding the choice task, participants were exposed to a laboratory stressor. Physiological stress reactivity was a predictor of altruistic decision making in younger adults, such that individuals with higher stress reactivity made more generous choices.

Research on life span changes in motivation suggests that altruistic motives become stronger with age, but no prior research has examined how altruism affects tolerance for temporal delays. Experiment 1 used a realistic financial decision making task involving choices for gains, losses, and donations. Each decision required an intertemporal choice between a smaller-immediate and a larger-later option. Participants more often chose the larger-later option in the context of donations than in the context of losses; thus, parting with more of their overall capital when the act of doing so benefited a charity. As predicted, the magnitude of this “altruism effect” was amplified in older relative to younger adults. This pattern was replicated in a second experiment that was conducted online to minimize the influence of demand characteristics. Overall, these findings add to the literature on an age-related increase in altruism, and are the first to demonstrate its effects on intertemporal choice.

Furthermore, older adults showed an overall higher percentage of delayed choices and reduced activity in the dorsal striatum than younger adults. This points to a reduced reward sensitivity of the dorsal striatum in older adults.

In this study, we investigated how decision conflict affects the neural mechanisms of intertemporal decision-making in younger and older adults. To individually adjust the level of decision conflict we determined the indifference point (IDP) in intertemporal decision-making for each participant. During functional magnetic resonance imaging, participants performed choice options close to their IDP (high conflict) or far away from the IDP (low conflict). In younger adults, decision conflict leads to reduced delay discounting and lower discount rates are associated with higher working memory (WM) capacity. In older adults, high decision conflict is associated with enhanced discounting, hypoactivation in the ventral striatum as well diminished ventral striatal representations of differences in subjective values. Taken together, our results show that under enhanced decision conflict, younger adults engage in a more reflective decision mode that reflects individual differences in WM capacity.

Impulsivity is the concept that individuals value immediate rewards and disregard future costs. Objective To determine the association between impulsivity and consumption of fast food among employed adults and to explore their reasons for eating fast food. Design A cross-sectional, online survey was conducted; participants were recruited using a mass electronic mailing. Participants/setting Four hundred seventy-eight adults employed in a university setting completed the survey. Main outcome measures The association between frequency of fast-food consumption and impulsivity was assessed. Impulsivity is assessed by the area under the delay discounting curve (AUC). The AUC is estimated by using a binary choice delay discounting task incorporating hypothetical monetary rewards. Greater AUC reflects lower impulsivity. Statistical analyses performed Analysis of variance, Student’s t tests, and Pearson correlation coefficients were used to measure unadjusted associations among demographic variables, fast-food consumption, and AUC. Linear regression was used to assess whether AUC was a significant predictor of having consumed fast food in the past 7 days, controlling for age, total household income, and education. Results The majority (67%) of the participants reported eating one or more meals from a fast-food restaurant or pizza place in the past 7 days. The mean number of meals was 2.8±2.5 per week among those who reported eating at a fast-food restaurant or pizza place. Both fast-food consumption and body mass index (BMI) were correlated with greater impulsivity. Controlling for age, total household income, and education level, fast-food consumption was negatively related to AUC (P=0.017). The most commonly reported reasons for consuming fast food were convenience and to socialize. Conclusions These findings indicate that greater impulsivity was associated with greater fast-food consumption. Successful efforts to encourage healthful dietary behaviors might emphasize methods to overcome impulsivity, such as reward substitution and precommitment.","2016-01-01","2022-03-11 13:19:11","2022-03-11 13:19:11","2022-03-11 13:19:11","61-68","","1","116","","Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics","Impulsivity and Fast-Food Consumption","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","<p>https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&amp;hl=en&amp;user=2dbTyfEAAAAJ&amp;citation_for_view=2dbTyfEAAAAJ:ULOm3_A8WrAC</p>","","","","Impulsivity; Delay discounting; Convenience; Dietary behaviors; Fast food","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

But, despite the ever-increasing importance of the topic, few studies have investigated this behavior among senior citizens. The handful of studies that have been conducted have produced conflicting results and focused on gains as opposed to losses. These conflicting results may in part be due to demographic confounds and the inherent variability that comes with aging. Here, demographic confounds and variability due to aging were minimized by studying three groups: middle-aged, unimpaired older, and impaired older adults. Participants were asked to choose between sooner−smaller and later−larger monetary rewards and losses. Results indicated that impaired older adults discounted the future more than unimpaired older adults. Interestingly, middle-aged adults discounted future gains at a similar rate as impaired older adults, but discounted future losses less than impaired older adults (and similarly to unimpaired older adults). This may suggest that unimpaired older adults have developed a compensatory mechanism that leads to more cautious, patient choices. We discuss these results in the context of the neurobiology and neuropsychology of aging and decision-making.

Accordingly, the present study examined the relation between discounting of hypothetical money and real liquid rewards in young adults (Experiment 1) and older adults (Experiment 2). At the group level, young adults discounted monetary rewards more steeply than the older adults, but there was no significant age difference with respect to liquid rewards. At the individual level, the rates at which young and older participants discounted each reward type were stable over a two- to fifteen-week interval (rs>70), but there was no significant correlation between the rates at which they discounted the two reward types.

We propose a potential explanation for this puzzle, namely that age differences in decision performance result from the interplay between two sets of cognitive capabilities that impact decision making, one in which older adults fare worse (i.e., fluid intelligence) and one in which they fare better (i.e., crystallized intelligence). Specifically, we hypothesized that older adults’ higher levels of crystallized intelligence can provide an alternate pathway to good decisions when the fluid intelligence pathway declines. The performance of older adults relative to younger adults therefore depends on the relative importance of each type of intelligence for the decision at hand. We tested this complementary capabilities hypothesis in a broad sample of younger and older adults, collecting a battery of standard cognitive measures and measures of economically important decision-making “traits”—including temporal discounting, loss aversion, financial literacy, and debt literacy. We found that older participants performed as well as or better than younger participants on these four decision-making measures. Structural equation modeling verified our hypothesis: Older participants’ greater crystallized intelligence offset their lower levels of fluid intelligence for temporal discounting, financial literacy, and debt literacy, but not for loss aversion. These results have important implications for public policy and for the design of effective decision environments for older adults.

Previous studies have found inconsistent results on the relationship between age and delay discounting, and few studies have been conducted using Chinese participants. The current study aimed to clarify this relationship using a relatively large sample of Chinese adults with a wide age range (viz., 18 to 86years old). A total of 1288 individuals completed the Monetary Choice Questionnaire. Results showed that the rate of delay discounting increased with age across adulthood, with younger participants (18–30years) discounting less than both middle-aged participants (31–60years) and older participants (over 60years); and middle-aged participants discounting less than older participants. Furthermore, when the reward magnitude was large, participants were more likely to wait for delayed rewards. The increase in delay discounting rate from middle-aged adults to older adults might be explained by the life-cycle theory. The increase in delay discounting rate from young adults to middle-aged adults may reflect that young adults expect much time and a variety of future positive life events in the rest of their lives.","2016-02-01","2022-03-11 13:21:25","2022-03-11 13:21:25","2022-03-11 13:21:25","205-209","","","90","","Personality and Individual Differences","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","<p>https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&amp;hl=en&amp;user=SBrftrYAAAAJ&amp;citation_for_view=SBrftrYAAAAJ:YsMSGLbcyi4C</p>","/Users/abagaini/Zotero/storage/XDLV35TS/S0191886915300271.html","","","Delay discounting; Monetary reward; Age differences; Chinese; Lifespan","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We investigated the neural systems supporting intertemporal decisions in healthy younger and older adults. Using functional neuroimaging, we find that aging is associated with a shift in the brain areas that respond to delayed rewards. Although we replicate findings that brain regions associated with the mesolimbic dopamine system respond preferentially to immediate rewards, we find a separate region in the ventral striatum with very modest time dependence in older adults. Activation in this striatal region was relatively insensitive to delay in older but not younger adults. Since the dopamine system is believed to support associative learning about future rewards over time, our observed transfer of function may be due to greater experience with delayed rewards as people age. Identifying differences in the neural systems underlying these decisions may contribute to a more comprehensive model of age-related change in intertemporal choice.","2011","2022-03-11 13:22:08","2022-03-14 12:16:02","2022-03-11 13:22:08","","","","5","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Frontiers","","","<p>https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&amp;hl=en&amp;user=SyS8rVcAAAAJ&amp;cstart=20&amp;pagesize=80&amp;citation_for_view=SyS8rVcAAAAJ:YsMSGLbcyi4C</p>","/Users/abagaini/Zotero/storage/FINMLRCX/Samanez-Larkin et al. - 2011 - Age Differences in Striatal Delay Sensitivity duri.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A computerized task was employed in which participants were asked to choose between larger rewards available at a specified time in the future—either £100 or £1,000 (approximately $200 and $2,000, respectively)— or a smaller reward available immediately. The subjective value of the reward decreased with increasing delay for each of the 3 age groups. A hyperbola-like function adequately described the group discounting data. The adolescent group discounted significantly more than the adult group when the larger later reward (LLR) was £100 but not when the LLR was £1,000. The adolescents discounted significantly more than the older adult group when the LLR was either £100 or £1,000. There were no significant differences in discounting between the adult and older adult groups.

Further, much of past research has often been underpowered, drawn from populations of convenience, and produced findings that have not always been replicated. Here we tested a large (n = 2,564), heterogeneous sample, and employed a novel analytic approach: using three machine learning algorithms to model the relationship between income and age, gender, height, race, zip code, education, occupation, and discounting. We found that delay discounting is more predictive of income than age, ethnicity, or height. We then used a holdout data set to test the robustness of our findings.

The present within-subjects study used online crowdsourcing (Amazon Mechanical Turk, or MTurk) to assess the discounting of hypothetical delayed money (and cigarettes in smokers) under four hypothetical framing conditions differing in the availability of reinforcement during delays. At one extreme, participants were free to leave their computer without returning, and engage in any behavior during reward delays (modeling typical human tasks). At the opposite extreme, participants were required to stay at their computer and engage in little other behavior during reward delays (modeling typical nonhuman tasks). Discounting rates increased as an orderly function of opportunity cost. Results also indicated predominantly hyperbolic discounting, the “magnitude effect,” steeper discounting of cigarettes than money, and positive correlations between discounting rates of these commodities. This is the first study to test the effects of opportunity costs on discounting, and suggests that procedural differences may partially account for observed species differences in discounting.","2015","2022-03-11 13:26:55","2022-03-11 13:26:55","2022-03-11 13:26:55","87-107","","1","103","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Wiley Online Library","","_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/jeab.110","<p>https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&amp;hl=en&amp;user=B4V-vI8AAAAJ&amp;citation_for_view=B4V-vI8AAAAJ:UebtZRa9Y70C</p>","/Users/abagaini/Zotero/storage/IRHFTCN4/Johnson et al. - 2015 - Opportunity costs of reward delays and the discoun.pdf; /Users/abagaini/Zotero/storage/4WV6IB33/jeab.html","","","human; delay discounting; cigarette; crowdsourcing; hypothetical; money; opportunity cost","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In intertemporal choices such as these, individuals tend to discount the value of future rewards, a tendency known as temporal discounting. Most people exhibit some degree of temporal discounting, but the rate at which people discount future rewards varies widely. Two neurocognitive systems have been proposed as potential candidates for mediating individual differences in discounting: executive function and declarative memory. Both of these functions decline as people age, at rates that vary across individuals. Here we leverage this variability in cognitive abilities among older adults (both cognitively normal and with mild cognitive impairment, MCI) to investigate associations between temporal discounting and executive function versus declarative memory. We find that neuropsychological measures of declarative memory (episodic memory retrieval and semantic fluency), but not executive function (Trail Making Test and lexical fluency), are associated with temporal discounting. People with better memory discount delayed rewards less. Consistent with this, individuals diagnosed with MCI show steeper discount rates compared to cognitively normal older adults. In contrast, executive function, but not declarative memory, is associated with the extent to which an individual is risk-neutral, or expected-value maximizing, in a risky choice task. These findings elucidate the inconsistent literature on aging and economic preferences, and they suggest that distinct neural systems mediate individual differences in the risk and time domain.","2018-09-27","2022-03-11 13:28:10","2022-03-11 13:28:10","2022-03-11 13:28:10","","","","","","","","","","","","PsyArXiv","","en-us","","","","","OSF Preprints","","DOI: 10.31234/osf.io/vb743 type: article","<p>https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&amp;hl=en&amp;user=EGPOCPYAAAAJ&amp;cstart=20&amp;pagesize=80&amp;citation_for_view=EGPOCPYAAAAJ:MXK_kJrjxJIC</p>","/Users/abagaini/Zotero/storage/PNGSRZVP/Lempert et al. - 2018 - Declarative memory, but not executive function, is.pdf","","","Memory; Social and Behavioral Sciences; Cognitive Psychology; Judgment and Decision Making; Cognitive Neuroscience; Neuroscience","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

According to life-history theories, prioritizing immediacy is indicative of an accelerated strategy (i.e. reaching reproductive maturity quickly and producing many offspring at the cost of long-term investment). Previous work extrapolating life-history theories to facultative calibration of life-history traits within individuals has theorized that cues to mortality can trigger an accelerated strategy; however, compelling evidence for this hypothesis in modern humans is lacking. We assessed whether country-level life expectancy predicts individual future discounting behaviour across multiple intertemporal choice items in a sample of 13 429 participants from 54 countries. Individuals in countries with lower life expectancy were more likely to prefer an immediate reward to one that is delayed. Individuals from countries with greater life expectancy were especially more willing to wait for a future reward when the relative gain in choosing the future reward was large and/or the delay period was short. These results suggest that cues to mortality can influence the way individuals evaluate intertemporal decisions, which in turn can inform life-history trade-offs. We also found that older (but not very old) participants were more willing to wait for a future reward when there is a greater relative gain and/or shorter delay period, consistent with theoretical models that suggest individuals are more future-orientated at middle age.","","2022-03-11 13:28:40","2022-03-11 13:28:40","2022-03-11 13:28:40","20180304","","1880","285","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","royalsocietypublishing.org (Atypon)","","Publisher: Royal Society","<p>https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&amp;hl=en&amp;user=5MqrYB8AAAAJ&amp;cstart=20&amp;pagesize=80&amp;citation_for_view=5MqrYB8AAAAJ:ZuybSZzF8UAC</p>","/Users/abagaini/Zotero/storage/H6CXSEZH/Lee et al. - Individual-specific mortality is associated with h.pdf","","","delay discounting; ageing; cross-cultural research; intertemporal choice; life expectancy; life-history theory","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Such delay discounting has been linked to many behavioral and health problems, since people choose smaller short-term gains over greater long-term gains. We investigated whether the effect of delays on the subjective value of rewards is expressed in how people move when they make choices. Over 600 patrons of the RISK LAB exhibition hosted by the Science Gallery DublinTM played a short computer game in which they used a computer mouse to choose between amounts of money at various delays. Typical discounting effects were observed and decision dynamics indicated that choosing smaller short-term rewards became easier (i.e., shorter response times, tighter trajectories, less vacillation) as the delays until later rewards increased. Based on a sequence of choices, subjective values of delayed outcomes were estimated and decision dynamics during initial choices predicted these values. Decision dynamics are affected by subjective values of available options and thus provide a means to estimate such values.","2016-02-12","2022-03-11 13:34:53","2022-03-11 13:34:53","2022-03-11 13:34:53","20740","","1","6","","Sci Rep","Decisions in Motion","","","","","","","en","2016 The Author(s)","","","","www.nature.com","","Number: 1 Publisher: Nature Publishing Group","<p>https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&amp;hl=en&amp;user=zNJ9v-oAAAAJ&amp;cstart=20&amp;pagesize=80&amp;sortby=pubdate&amp;citation_for_view=zNJ9v-oAAAAJ:_Qo2XoVZTnwC</p>","/Users/abagaini/Zotero/storage/G74TCPNW/O’Hora et al. - 2016 - Decisions in Motion Decision Dynamics during Inte.pdf; /Users/abagaini/Zotero/storage/A7IYCN8L/srep20740.html","","","Decision; Medical research","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To address this issue, a dataset was analyzed containing 42,863 participants’ responses to a single delay-discounting choice, along with self-report behaviors that can be considered as impulsive. Choice of a smaller-sooner sum was associated with several demographics: younger age, lower income, and lower education; and impulsive behaviors: earlier age of first sexual activity and recent relationship infidelity, smoking, and higher body mass index. These findings suggest that at least an aspect of delay discounting preference is associated with a general trait influencing other forms of impulsivity, and therefore that high delay discounting is another form of impulsive behavior.","2009-12-01","2022-03-11 13:34:58","2022-03-11 13:34:58","2022-03-11 13:34:58","973-978","","8","47","","Personality and Individual Differences","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","<p>https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&amp;hl=en&amp;user=44meadUAAAAJ&amp;citation_for_view=44meadUAAAAJ:Tyk-4Ss8FVUC</p>","/Users/abagaini/Zotero/storage/PKXWC6L2/S0191886909003468.html; /Users/abagaini/Zotero/storage/63ZH5ZY6/Reimers et al. - 2009 - Associations between a one-shot delay discounting .pdf","","","Education; Age; Obesity; Delay discounting; Drug use; Income; Sexual behavior; Smoking","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

While undergoing functional neuroimaging, participants (N = 75) made incentive compatible choices between a smaller monetary reward with lower physical effort, higher probability, or a shorter time delay versus a larger monetary reward with higher physical effort, lower probability, or a longer time delay. Behavioral preferences were estimated from observed choices, and subjective values were computed using individual hyperbolic discount functions. We found that discount rates were uncorrelated across tasks. Despite this apparent behavioral dissociation between preferences, we found overlapping subjective value-related activity in the medial prefrontal cortex across all three tasks. We found no consistent evidence for age differences in either preferences or the neural representations of subjective value across adulthood. These results suggest that while the tolerance of decision features is behaviorally dissociable, subjective value signals share a common representation across adulthood.","2018-05-01","2022-03-11 13:35:10","2022-03-11 13:35:10","2022-03-11 13:35:09","449-459","","5","13","","Social Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience","","","","","","","","","","","","","Silverchair","","","<p style=""text-align: left;"">https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&amp;hl=en&amp;user=6chr-JsAAAAJ&amp;citation_for_view=6chr-JsAAAAJ:WF5omc3nYNoC</p>","/Users/abagaini/Zotero/storage/DZB65CAT/Seaman et al. - 2018 - Subjective value representations during effort, pr.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Participants (n=1,122) were randomized to one of three conditions: Future Focus (FF), Present Focus (PF), and Non-Temporal Focus (NTF) intended respectively to decrease, increase, or have no effect on delay discounting. Participants then completed the Monetary Choice Questionnaire, a brief assessment of delay discounting rate. Participants randomized to FF exhibited significantly lower discounting rates than those randomized to PF or NTF conditions. Race, Hispanic background, social self-monitoring, education, and cigarette smoking also accounted for a significant amount of variance in the discounting model.

Of the many functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies of DD, few have investigated the correlation between individual differences in DD rate and brain activation related to DD trial difficulty, with difficult DD trials expected to activate putative executive function brain areas involved in impulse control. In the current study, we correlated patterns of brain activation as measured by fMRI during difficult vs. easy trials of a DD task with DD rate (k) in obese women. Difficulty was defined by how much a reward choice deviated from an individual’s ‘indifference point’, or the point where the subjective preference for an immediate and a delayed reward was approximately equivalent. We found that greater delay discounting was correlated with less modulation of activation in putative executive function brain areas, such as the middle and superior frontal gyri and inferior parietal lobule, in response to difficult compared to easy DD trials. These results support the suggestion that increased impulsivity is associated with deficient functioning of executive function areas of the brain.","2013-06-01","2022-03-11 13:36:17","2022-03-11 13:36:17","2022-03-11 13:36:17","116-128","","2","7","","Brain Imaging and Behavior","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","<p>https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&amp;hl=en&amp;user=hTGh2hoAAAAJ&amp;citation_for_view=hTGh2hoAAAAJ:eQOLeE2rZwMC</p>","/Users/abagaini/Zotero/storage/AILIZVMT/Stoeckel et al. - 2013 - Greater impulsivity is associated with decreased b.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Evidence from functional neuroimaging data implies an association between impulsivity and cortical as well as subcortical areas of the reward system. Discounting future rewards during impulsive decisions can be related to activation in the orbitofrontal cortex and striatum. Cortical structural changes in prefrontal regions have been found for introspective impulsivity measures. The present study focuses on brain regions associated with delay discounting to investigate structural manifestations of trait impulsivity. To test this, seventy subjects underwent structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) followed by a behavioral delay discounting task outside of the scanner to measure impulsivity with questions like: “Would you like to have 3€ immediately or 10€ in 5 days?”. The amount of smaller-but-sooner decisions was calculated and used as a measure of behavioral impulsivity. Furthermore, we estimated subject’s individual delay discounting parameter K reflecting the tendency to discount future rewards. Behaviorally, we found strong evidence in favor of a discounting utility model compared to a standard hyperbolic model of choice valuation. Neuronally, we focused on cortical and subcortical brain structure and investigated the association of behavioral impulsivity with delay discounting tendencies and gray matter volume. Voxel-based morphometric analyses showed positive correlations between delay discounting and gray matter volume in the striatum. Additional analyses using Freesurfer provided evidence for a positive correlation between delay discounting and gray matter volume of the caudate. Taken together, our study provides strong evidence for a structural manifestation of time-stable trait impulsivity in the human brain.","2015","2022-03-11 13:36:21","2022-03-14 12:16:44","2022-03-11 13:36:21","","","","9","","","Impulsivity relates to striatal gray matter volumes in humans","","","","","","","","","","","","Frontiers","","","<p>https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&amp;hl=en&amp;user=zT139WMAAAAJ&amp;citation_for_view=zT139WMAAAAJ:WF5omc3nYNoC</p>","/Users/abagaini/Zotero/storage/EIANWJW5/Tschernegg et al. - 2015 - Impulsivity relates to striatal gray matter volume.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Our study analyzes in detail how the SDR is related to age, health, and survival probability, by surveying a sample of individuals in townships around Durban, South Africa. In contrast to previous studies, we find that age is not significantly related to the SDR, but both physical health and survival expectations have a U-shaped relationship with the SDR. Individuals in very poor health have high discount rates, and those in very good health also have high discount rates. Similarly, those with expected survival probability on the extremes have high discount rates. Therefore, health and survival probability, and not age, seem to be predictors of one’s SDR in an area of the world with high morbidity and mortality.

Delay discounting (DD) measures simplify the DoG procedure and focus on monetary rewards. The aim of this study was to investigate age differences in DoG and DD from childhood to old age using a test that is suitable for both children and adults. Furthermore, investigations were conducted on the association between DoG/DD and two future orientation constructs [future time perspective (FTP) and episodic future thinking (EFT)] as well as age differences in these constructs. Participants from five age groups (9–14, 18–25, 35–55, 65–80, 80+) participated in the study (N = 96). While we found no age difference for DoG, DD was the lowest [i.e., self-control (SC) was the highest] in young/middle adults; however, it was the highest (i.e., SC was the lowest) in children and old/oldest adults. Furthermore, we found significant age differences for DD and FTP. As predicted, there were strong correlations between DoG and FTP and between DD and FTP, but not between DoG/DD and EFT. These results indicate that age differences in SR vary across the measures used. Individuals who generally think and act in a future-oriented manner have a stronger ability to delay gratification.","2018","2022-03-11 13:41:46","2022-03-14 12:08:14","2022-03-11 13:41:46","","","","8","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Frontiers","","","<p>https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&amp;hl=en&amp;user=VHdhYgEAAAAJ&amp;citation_for_view=VHdhYgEAAAAJ:IjCSPb-OGe4C</p>","/Users/abagaini/Zotero/storage/Y79NN9BW/Göllner et al. - 2018 - Delay of Gratification, Delay Discounting and thei.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
